    $speakerText        = "<p>Dave Farley is a thought-leader in the field of Continuous Delivery, DevOps and Software Development in general. </p>
<p>He is co-author of the Jolt-award winning book 'Continuous Delivery' a regular conference speaker and blogger and one of the authors of the Reactive Manifesto. </p>
<br>
<p> Dave has been having fun with computers for over 30 years. During that period he has worked on most types of software, from firmware, through tinkering with operating systems and device drivers, to writing games, and commercial applications of all shapes and sizes. He started working in large scale distributed systems about 25 years ago, doing research into the development of loose-coupled, message-based systems - a forerunner of MicroService architectures. </p>
 <br>
<p>Dave has a wide range of experience leading the development of complex software in teams, both large and small, in the UK and USA. Dave was an early adopter of agile development techniques, employing iterative development, continuous integration and significant levels of automated testing on commercial projects from the early 1990s. </p>
 <br>
<p>Dave is the former Head of Software development at LMAX Ltd, home of the OSS Disruptor, a company that are well known for the excellence of their code and the exemplary nature of their development process.</p>

    $speakerSessionText = "<p>Many people working in software development spend their careers without seeing what good looks like. Our history is littered with inefficient processes creating poor quality output, too late to capitalise on the expected business value. How have we got to this state? How do we get past it? What does good really look like?
Continuous Delivery changes the economics of software development, find out how and why.</p>

<p> 2nd Talk:</p>
<p>
Writing and maintaining a suite acceptance tests that can give you a high level of confidence in the behaviour and configuration of your system is a complex task. In this talk Dave will describe approaches to acceptance testing that allow teams to: work quickly and effectively; build excellent functional coverage for complex enterprise-scale systems; manage and maintain those tests in the face of change, and of evolution in both the codebase and the understanding of the business problem. </p>
 <br>
<p>This talk will answer the following questions, and more: How do you fail fast? How do you make your testing scalable? How do you isolate test cases from one-another? How do you maintain a working body of tests when you radically change the interface to your system? </p>";
