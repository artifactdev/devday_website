# Introduction

The Dev Day Dresden is a community project, and it's website is as well. We're happy you're considering helping us improve the website and it's services.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

We welcome pull requests, bug reports, or general ideas for improvements!

If you'd like to attend the next Dev Day, like to become a sponsor, or have any other questions regarding the event itself, please write to [info@devday.de](mailto:<info@devday.de>).
